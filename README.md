# Youtube-Transcript-Summarization-using-Transformers

The Project was done in Google Colab. After uploading the colab file in github, some of the outputs line got interupted. Sorry for the inconvenience<br>

I have used 2 different models which was pre-trained for text summarization. For YouTube Transcription, I have used a library. One of the two models are Transformers and other one is BART. I have presented them sequentially. 

The reason behind choosing this was I was previously introduced with Higginface models like Transformers, Stable Diffusion AI. This is the reason I knew some of the works like sentiment analysis, summarization and text to image generation. This is the reason I have choosen this problem interest.

Thank You
